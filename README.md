weigh-in
========

A simple node, jquery and flot based weight watcher.

Generate a graph of your fluctuating weight, fat and waist measurements.

To use, run weigh-in from within the distributed directory.
It listens on port 6503. The distribution comes with one user, test, so pointing your browser at http://localhost:6503/test will show you the test profile. To add a new profile, create an empty file profile-name in the data directory and use http://localhost:6503/profile-name to get started.
